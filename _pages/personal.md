### Hiking
During weekends or breaks, I like to drive around and go hiking. It's usually nice to emerge yourself with beautiful nature.

### Pets
Meet my cats Dolly & Adam :smile_cat:â€‹. I like to play with them when I am done with coding in midnight. They are shy in general but not to me. :v: I adopted them (sibilings) from [@Atlanta Humane Society](https://atlantahumane.org/) in Fall 2022.

### Animations
I'm a fan of Japanese culture and anime. I used to watch a lot of anime each season. Now since I am in grad school, I have less free time to explore each of them. Feel free to check what I am watching [this season](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/Zhixin_Song?status=1) and follow me on [@MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/profile/Zhixin_Song).

### Music
I'm a big fan of classical music and my favorite  composer is [@Ludwig van Beethoven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven) and favorite  piece is [@Requiem in D K. 626](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp2SJN4UiE4).
