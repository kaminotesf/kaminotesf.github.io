I am a third-year PhD student in School of Physics at Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by CSE faculty [Prof. Spencer Bryngelson](https://comp-physics.group/). My current research focuses on quantum algorithms for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) with an application to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). I received my B.S. in Physics from [Ohio State University](https://physics.osu.edu/) with a minor in Mathematics and Philosophy. Please check [CV](/assets/pdf/Zhixin_Song_CV.pdf) for more details.

Prior to my Ph.D. study, I worked as a research and development intern at the Institue for Quantum Computing (IQC) Baidu Research for one year, supervised by [Dr. Xin Wang](https://www.xinwang.info/) (now Professor at HKUST). I also interned at JPMorgan Chase GTAR Quantum team to research on privacy-preserving methods for distributed quantum machine learning during Summer 2023.
