I am a 3rd-year PhD student in the School of Physics at Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by CSE faculty [Prof. Spencer Bryngelson](https://comp-physics.group/). My current research focuses on quantum algorithms for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) with an application to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). I received my B.S. in Physics from Ohio State University with a minor in Mathematics and Philosophy.

Prior to my Ph.D. study, I worked as a research and development intern at the Institue of Quantum Computing (IQC) Baidu for one year, supervised by [Dr. Xin Wang](https://www.xinwang.info/) (now Professor at HKUST). I also interned at JP Morgan Chase GTAR Quantum team during Summer 2023.
