For decades, stored-program architectures (predominantly Von Neumann model of computing) have been the foundation of computing systems, but as the demands for performance (speed, real-time responsiveness, code size, and energy consumption), reliability, trust, security, and privacy grow, going beyond such traditional models is imperative. This necessitates rethinking the complete hardware and software stack.â€¯ CRNCH aims to promote this goal through the involvement of outstanding Georgia Tech PhD students engaged in CRNCH-related research.
